**1 Linear search** 
is a simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends. 
**Explanation:**

Function Definition: linear_search(arr, target) takes a list arr and the target value to search for.
Iteration: 
The enumerate(arr) function is used to loop through each element along with its index.
Comparison: 
If the current element matches the target, its index is returned.
Not Found: 
If the loop completes without finding the target, -1 is returned to indicate that the target is not in the list.
Example Usage:
Demonstrates how to use the linear_search function with a sample list and target value.
This method is straightforward and efficient for small to moderately sized lists. For very large lists, more advanced search algorithms like binary search might be more appropriate, especially if the list is sorted.
